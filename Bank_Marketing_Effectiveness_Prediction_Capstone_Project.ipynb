        "### By analyzing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviors and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. This will not only allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing undesirable advertisements for certain customers.\n",
